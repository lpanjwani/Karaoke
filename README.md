# Karaoke Application

## Linux Optimized Running Instructions

Compile Java Code with `javac` and run with the following command line arguments:

1. Library File Path (String): Relative URL of the Library file.

NOTE: All Command Line Arguments are nameless and are appended to the `java` runtime command.

## Background

The aim of the task at hand is to gather, plan the requirements, design, implement, test and document the making of a karaoke application that achieves the highest levels of performance whilst including fast song controls (play, pause, next) along with various other algorithms. The project has been established in a way that achieves the proper utilization of project management methodologies whilst keeping in mind the important concepts of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This enables proper focus on the key areas of concern. Using the Java Software Development Kit (SDK), I developed a client-side application with karaoke application logic. The codebase has been commented thoroughly with line comments keeping in mind developer understandability, SDK integrations & open source contributions. The codebase uses all concepts of object-oriented programming with maximum code reusability that can be obtained. Thus, resulting in leading to the achievement of cross-platform JavaFX application that allows dynamic song lists with graphical options to add more. All of these can be used in the providence to a next karaoke version of major music streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music.
